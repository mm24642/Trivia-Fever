# üí° Trivia Fever

Trivia Fever is a fullstack web application that allows users to play trivia games, keep track of scores, and create your very own questions! The application utilizes React to display a responsive frontend UI, Express and Node.js to host a backend API, and MongoDB as a database solution to store trivia scores and questions. 

Trivia Fever also relies on the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API to serve trivia questions not created on the site, to ensure users have a variety of questions to play. Jest unit testing is also implemented in both the client and server to verify the application's function. 

Finally, the application is tested and deployed online on [fly.io](https://trivia-fever.fly.dev) through a CI/CD pipeline implemented in Github Actions!

## üöÄ Installation and Usage

Trivia Fever is hosted live at [trivia-fever.fly.dev](https://trivia-fever.fly.dev) to be used! 

You can play games without logging in, but you are encouraged to login on the login page to be able to track your scores and create your own questions. 

Games of trivia are 10 questions long, with 20 seconds for each question, so make sure you are prepared as these questions cover all topics!
